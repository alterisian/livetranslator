    <h1>Boquercom-live event captions</h1>

    <p>Thank you to my Spanish-speaking Málageuno friends for seeding this project with their audio - on whatsapp of course.
      This helped validate that we could use AI to translate live events to translate Spanish audio to English text reasonably acurately.
      Thank you to: Amelia, Anton, Israel, Luna, Noela, Rafeal, Rakel.

    <p>In the next phase we started to build Real time translation. This was done initially with the rtve 24 hour news feed. (We're open to sponsorship folks ;) Though still would love to get sponsorship from Victoria jaja).
      At this stage, and onwards we have been lucky to get significant contributions from the #MálagaTech community. Especially Jay, for devops, and merging the various efforts, and Greg for checking the effectiveness of the translations. 
      <br/>We had been encouraged by DMM's approach to events, and Pedro using OBS, and various other tech / event tools. It was great to see if we could get this working for us, and with Jay and Piotri this was very possible.
      <br/>We're now building a community around Boquercom, and are keen for more Spanish developers, as well as people to help with community communications of updates.
      <br/>Next on the technical roadmap is allowing anyone with an audio source, at an event, to run Boquercom. Initially with WebRTC, and via web browsers on latpops or phones.
