    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold my-6">In the beginning Spanish friends and Ian.</h2>

    <p>Thank you to my Spanish-speaking Málageuno friends for seeding this project with their audio - on whatsapp of course.
      This helped validate that we could use AI to translate live events by translating Spanish audio to English text reasonably acurately.
      Thank you to: Amelia, Anton, Israel, Luna, Noela, Rafeal, Rakel.            
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold my-6">Then live streaming translation, with a local Málaga team.</h2>
    <p>In the next phase we started to build Real time translation. This was done initially with the rtve 24 hour news feed. (We're open to sponsorship folks ;) Though still would love to get sponsorship from Victoria jaja).
      At this stage, and onwards we have been lucky to get significant contributions from the #MálagaTech community. Especially Jay, for devops, and merging the various efforts, and Greg for checking the effectiveness of the translations. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold my-6">Attending local events.</h2>
    <p>  
      Jesus and team had done an amazing job with the Global AI day at Málaga University. 
      We had been further encouraged by DMM's approach to events, and Pedro using OBS, and various other tech / event tools. It was great to see if we could get this working for us, and with Jay and Piotri this was very possible.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold my-6">Growing the Málaga community</h2>
    <p>
      We're now building a collaborative community around Boquercom, and are keen for more Spanish developers, as well as people to help with community communications of updates.
      <br/>Next on the technical roadmap is allowing anyone with an audio source, at an event, to run Boquercom. Initially with WebRTC, and via web browsers on latpops or phones.
